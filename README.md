# Caesar Cipher Encoder/Decoder

A simple Caesar Cipher web application that lets users **encode** and **decode** messages using a key between 1 and 26. Built with **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## 🔐 What is the Caesar Cipher?

The Caesar Cipher is a classic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet. This tool allows you to both **encode** and **decode** using this method.
